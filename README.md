[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pycmg/badge/?version=latest)](https://pycmg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

PyCMG is an open source software package for generating virtual concrete mesostructures. Is it implemented in Python.
PyCMG allows users to generate a custom concrete mesostructure using a CSV file.

The latest documentation for PyCMG is available at [pycmg.readthedocs.org](https://pycmg.readthedocs.org)

## Features

The features available in the current version of PyCMG are listed below. 

#### Full control over the shape of the aggregate
- Shape definition using enclosing ellipsoid
- Orientation
- Concavity (depth and width)
- Size

##### Interfacial transition zone (ITZ)
- Specification of an ITZ
- ITZ thickness
